## instructions

**STEP 1:** In a microwave-safe bowl, heat milk to warm (105°F – 115°F), not hot. Add 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and yeast to the bowl. Stir briefly. Allow yeast to sit undisturbed for about 5 minutes, until it wakes up (reactivates) and becomes foamy.

**STEP 2:** In the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, salt, eggs, vanilla, and yeast mixture.

**STEP 3:** Add in half the flour. Mix until blended.

**STEP 4:** Swap the dough hook for paddle attachment. Add remaining flour to the bowl. Mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is too sticky and wet, add more flour, one tablespoon at a time.
